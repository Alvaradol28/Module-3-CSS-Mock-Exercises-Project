# Module-3-CSS-Mock-Exercises-Project
Hello! This project is ready for review and revision! This is my first project submission to Springboard's coding bootcamp and will be reviewed together with a mentor. The project is separated into two parts. Part 1 includes the Mock exercises where positioning is needed to place elements in the desired spot. On the "Part 1 Base Code" HTML file, you can swimply swap out the stylesheets for the desired exercise you want to see using the stylesheets "1.1-1.5" on the left. 
1.1 is exercise 1 and 1.5 is exercise 5 of Part 1. 

Next, Part 2 contains the second half of the Mock exercises where design elements were created from scratch using HTML & CSS in order to recreate the elements designed in the "images" folder (located in the directory: Part 2). Some creative liberties were taken with regards to certain GIFS. Open Part 2 Exercises.html & css. first to see all three mock exercises consolidated onto one page. Open the HTML and CSS files "Part 2 Last Exercise" to see only the last and most complicated exercise element designed. I put this exercise on its own page because I was unable/(couldn't figure out) how to format it in the way that it needs to be with the other two design elements on the same page. 

Lastly, please see my Disclaimer on Work.txt regarding references used. 

Thank you for reviewing!
